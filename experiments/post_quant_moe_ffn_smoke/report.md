# Post-Quant MoE FFN DuQuant-vs-OSE Benchmark

This benchmark measures a synthetic post-quant W8A8 FFN runtime path. Calibration, DuQuant search, weight-side transforms, OSE channel selection, weight quantization, and packing are excluded.

`duquant_once` applies the gate/up DuQuant activation transform once and reuses it for both gate and up. `ours_ose_w8a8` removes that gate/up transform and adds a W8A8 top-k input-channel OSE branch. The optional down DuQuant transform is a common cost and is included when `include_down_duquant_transform=1`.
